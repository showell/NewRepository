# Compile a single .codex source file to CDX, TEXT, or IR by booting

# Input is loaded into guest memory at the serial ring buffer address (0x500000)

# Usage: compile.ps1 -Src <source.codex> -Out <out.cdx> -Log <log.out>
#        compile.ps1 ... -Kernel seed\Codex.cdx     # boot a specific compiler

# WHICH COMPILER THIS BOOTS, AND WHY IT MATTERS
#
# By default this is build-output\bare-metal\Codex.cdx -- NOT seed\Codex.cdx,
# and NOT reliably the SUT either. Build-Cdx and Build-Text in build.ps1 each
# copy their own kernel over that path before running, so it ends up holding
# whichever kernel the LAST compile phase used -- not whichever artifact the
# run produced. This line said "which is the SUT" until 2026-08-08; measured
# after a full green build.ps1 on that date, the file's content hash equalled
# seed\Codex.cdx, because phases after plug-binary compile against the seed.
#
# That is the dangerous direction. Verifying a codegen change with the default
# kernel boots the OLD compiler, the emitted wire is unchanged, and the honest
# reading of that is "my fix did nothing" -- when the fix was never in the
# binary under test. Pass -Kernel build\output\Sut.cdx to test what a gate
# just built.
#
# This has already produced a wrong answer. A per-chapter sweep of apps/works
# reported ~80 of 84 chapters compiling; the real figure against the depot seed
# was ~55, because build-output held a kernel from before the file-exists
# builtin was removed, and every chapter that called file-exists still resolved
# it. The sweep was measuring a compiler that no longer existed.
#
# So: the kernel is printed on stderr with its digest on every run. Read it.
# If you are measuring anything -- a sweep, a baseline, "does this chapter
# compile" -- pass -Kernel explicitly and know what you are asking.
#
#   compile.ps1 -Src x.codex -Out x.cdx -Log x.log -Kernel seed\Codex.cdx
#
# and compare that digest against the seed you think you are testing.
